# Password-Creator

Hello, here is your fully functional password generator to help anyone trying to keep sensitive data secure. The password generator will require the user to have at least an eight character password. The user will then be able to customize their password to how they see fit, a series of pop up boxes will ask if the user would like to have included in their password uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. If the user then decides they would like one of these options included in their password a new secure password will be created within those parameters. The passsword generater has been specifically created for ease of use and sound of mind. But don't just take my work for it got checkout your password generator at https://github.com/cjwerk/Password-Creator.git for the git repository and for the live deployed sit go to https://cjwerk.github.io/Password-Creator/ and start making secure passwords today.
